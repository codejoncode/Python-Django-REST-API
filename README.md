#DOCKER VS VAGRANT 

Virtualization technology to isolate the application from the machine its running on.  

What is docker? 

Open source containerization tool run app in light weight image.   Creates a docker file featuring all of the steps needed to build the application. 

Docker limitations  steeper learning curve.  

Vagrant  mange virtual development environments   

Hypervisor (i.e Virtualbox)   
Create a vagrant file that includes all steps to build  development server.  
Steamlined but complex version of Linux OS 
Easier learning curve vs. Docker  Wideer range of support  runs on any machine that supports Virtual Box  
Streamline workflow  All developers use supported OS   Just getting started Need support wider range of OS.
